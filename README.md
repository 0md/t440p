# t440p
Thinkpad T440p Hackintosh

Contains the following folders:

- `CLOVER`: put this in your EFI partition in `EFI` folder,
- `Kexts`: kexts to install in `Library/Extensions`.

This setup works flawlessly on High Sierra 10.13.6.

What works:

- Power management,
- Temperature sensors,
- Battery status,
- Brightness control,
- Sound,
- USB ports,
- Graphical acceleration (QE/CI).

For FHD (1920x1080) panels, I recommend to install [One Key HiDPI](https://github.com/xzhih/one-key-hidpi).
